This one will use that same profile. But for this, we will launch the browser, go to 1 convo, get the main content section, then either do these :
    - parse the html of the chat section and returns as markdown. 
    - copy the html to a file, then use the markitdown library to convert it to markdown.
Then return the result. Which is to serve as a finding of previous convo. 

Upon the below step, you might need to view and parse the html to discovery how to correctly fetch the content, the approach will be like this: use your browser to parse these to viewable format and return this to user, don't return the raw html. The viewable is markdown is good already, because the end result will be handled by llm, it can self heal WITHOUT needing too much of structure respond . 

The way we choose convo can have the scenarioS: 
    - Using an exact url like this: https://gemini.google.com/app/94cecb9cb34fa6cf
    - Or gem: https://gemini.google.com/gem/6a6f50987ce9

Also have the way to: 
    - list / search gem: 
        - https://gemini.google.com/gems/view 
    - 2 ways:
        - in home page, there is a left side bar which list recent convo: https://gemini.google.com. 
        - Go here: https://gemini.google.com/search, then type in and press enter, then wait for it to finish searching then use the html & markdown technique above to get the list of convo. 
            ![alt text](image.png)

For now we just need to get the data from there (just like we are searching), we don't need to chat with it. 

Upon complete, you must have evidence of done for me which contains these : 
- list of my gem. 
- search for "memory" gem, how many shows up
- list of my recent convo
- search for "dy", how many convo shows up. 
In each of the above, choose the first one, what is it's link. What is it most recent content (during your implement, enable a way so that we can get all content by scroll up up up up all the way then copy all the inner html of that section).
