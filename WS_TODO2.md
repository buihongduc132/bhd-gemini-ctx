1. Previous work is awesome. 
but I need some more update based on the previous work: 
    - view the html again, then see how to extra these info (if possible): msg sending by whom, at what time. 

2.
Then add a capability that to scroll the page up (you can check that if the content is no different then before then we can consider that is at the top). For this one, split the file to multiple md file , don't put all into 1, it will be super long. 
Test with this convo: https://gemini.google.com/app/868452c61789e8d8


3.
Then commit push things up.
